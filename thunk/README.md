The word "thunk" is a programming term that means "a piece of code that does some delayed work". 
Rather than execute some logic now, we can write a function body or code that can be used to perform the work later.

For Redux specifically, "thunks" are a pattern of writing functions with logic inside that can interact with a Redux store's dispatch and getState methods.

* Calling an API is not so straightforward while using the redux toolkit, and that’s why redux has a middleware name “createAsyncThunk()” which provided us with all the superpowers needed for handling API and response.*
